- A new cloud-base File Share Service has been developed to serve files to our distributors
- The FTP Server is built on a version of Windows that is no longer supported and needs to be retired
- A new system is being planned that will replace the Client application, but this will not be delivered before the FTP Server must be retired
- It is deemed impractical to modify the existing Client application

You should create and implement an adapter that will convert the interface of the File Share Service to the interface expected by the Client
